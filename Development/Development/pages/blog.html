  <h1> <font color="white"> IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON OUR BUSINESS.</font> </h1>
  <h3> <font color="white"> Technology is the great factor that has bought a huge difference in our daily lives. The evolution of technology has dramatically changed society. An endless number of people all over the world use and get benefit from modern technology, and the tremendous opportunities it provides play a significant role in almost all fields of human life.<br> <br>Technology has revolutionized the way companies conduct business by enabling small businesses to level the playing field with larger organizations. Business owners run their companies from laptops, tablets and smartphones, never even considering opening a brick-and-mortar presence. Just a few decades ago, if you walked into an office, you’d see employees tapping away on typewriters and chatting away on landline phones. If one worker wanted to communicate with another, it meant getting up and walking to that person’s desk, rather than sending an email. But technology continues to evolve, always impacting the way business leaders hire, market, budget and protect their investments.<br> <br> Thanks to social media and the internet, due to social media reaching consumers is easier than ever. By using various social platforms, even the newest small business can post content that helps interested customers find them. Instead of paying third parties for advertising in print or electronic media, today’s businesses are in charge of their own customer outreach. The result is a reduced cost that levels the playing field between large corporations and startups.<br><br> 
  As we all know there is always positive and negative in everything . The negative sight of technology is security. Having so much information on internet-connected servers means it’s susceptible to theft.Businesses now need to put significant effort into securing their networks and all connected devices. Otherwise, it might bring a big problem in future.<br><br> Though, technology has brought drastics change in our daily lives and made our lives much easier than before. The work that need effort years ago, now can be done easily without effort due to the use of advance technology. If we  focus on developing the technology than we can go more futher in future.<br><br> </div>
